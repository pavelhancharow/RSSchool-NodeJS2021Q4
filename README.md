# Ciphering CLI Tool

Ciphering CLI Tool is an encryption tool that may encode and decode a text by 3 substitution ciphers.

## Installation

Use the node package manager to install Ciphering CLI Tool.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

CLI tool should accept 3 options (short alias and full name):

1. -c, --config: config for ciphers Config is a string with pattern `{XY(-)}n`, where:

- `X` is a cipher mark:
  - `C` is for Caesar cipher (with shift 1)
  - `A` is for Atbash cipher
  - `R` is for ROT-8 cipher
- `Y` is flag of encoding or decoding (mandatory for Caesar cipher and ROT-8 cipher and should not be passed Atbash cipher)
  - `1` is for encoding
  - `0` is for decoding

2. -i, --input: a path to input file
3. -o, --output: a path to output file

For example, config `"C1-C1-R0-A"` means "encode by Caesar cipher => encode by Caesar cipher => decode by ROT-8 => use Atbash"

### Usage example:

```bash
$ node my_ciphering_cli -c "C1-C1-R0-A" -i "input.txt" -o "output.txt"
```

> input.txt `This is secret. Message about "_" symbol!`

> output.txt `Myxn xn nbdobm. Tbnnfzb ferlm "_" nhteru!`
